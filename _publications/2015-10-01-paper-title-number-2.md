Abstract
======
In the current era deaths due to heart disease have become a major issue. Approximately one person dies per minute due to heart disease. Data is generated and has to be stored daily because of fast growth in Information Technology. The data which is collected is converted into knowledge by data analysis by using various combinations of algorithms. Medical professionals working in the field of heart disease have their own limitations, they cannot predict the chance of getting heart disease up to high accuracy. This paper aims to improve Heart Disease predict accuracy using the Logistic Regression model of machine learning considering the health care dataset which classifies the patients whether they are having heart diseases or not according to the information in the record.
