Abstract
======
Across the world, people are facing unforeseen challenges due to Coronavirus pandemic. Almost 213 countries are under the influence of the virus and the whole world population is uncertain about how long this pandemic will last. The only thing that can prevent its exponential growth apart from a vaccine is to be well aware of the situation and follow the necessary precautions. In this paper, we design and develop an android application to spread awareness and to help the people of the world amid this COVID-19. The COWAR app connects the people with the Doctors and the administration to come together and fight the pandemic. With this app, one can track the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, check live statistics, check for symptoms, browse an interactive map, and also get prevention details. Mobile applications like these help to connect the authorities with people and provide the essential information and services needed in this pandemic. We have validated our app by distributing it with a large number of people and collecting the feedback on various features of the app.
